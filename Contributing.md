# Contributing

## How to contribute

- File issues.
- Edit/write documentation.
- Submit pull requests.
- Test in different environments.
- Raise awareness.

## Summary of tools

Following tools are getting used:

- `Angular` as primary target framework http://angular.io/
- `TypeScript` as primary language - https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- `ng-packagr` to generate Angular specific package format - https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr
- `compodoc` for API documentation - https://compodoc.app/
- `Jasmine` for test cases - https://jasmine.github.io/
- `Karma` for running test cases in browsers - http://karma-runner.github.io/
- `nodejs` during development - https://nodejs.org/
- `npm` for dependency management, packaging and distribution - https://www.npmjs.com/
- `git` for version control - https://git-scm.com/

## Initial setup

Instructions on setting up development environment:

- Install `node` and `npm` - https://nodejs.org/
- Checkout code from GitHub - you may fork the code first into your GitHub account.
- Use `npm i` to install dependencies:
  ```bash
  $ npm i
  ```

## Project structure

The project was originally generated by angular-cli (at Angular 2).
In those days there was no clear guideline on how to create and organize an
Angular library.
Later it switched to `ng-packagr` which brought quite a lot of sanity.
The source code is in `src` folder.
All the test case files are within `specs` which is not what typically Angular
projects do.

Because of compatibility reasons paths of specific files have been kept same.
While doing v8 - when v6 compatibility would be dropped, the source code is
likely to be rearranged.

## Setup a Stomp broker

- A Stomp broker is used for running the tests. I have been using RabbitMQ.
- Edit `spec/config/browser-config.js` and `spec/config/node-config.js` as per
  your setup. Defaults should work for as RabbitMQ default setup on localhost.
- Please note that in RabbitMQ you will need to enable Stomp and WebStomp plugins.
- By default RabbitMQ WebStomp will treat messages a text, you will need to tell
  it is use binary frames:
  ```bash
  $ echo 'web_stomp.ws_frame = binary' >> /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
  ```
- A RabbitMQ Dockerfile is provided with necessary plugins and configuration. To use it, run:
  ```bash
  $ docker build -t myrabbitmq rabbitmq/ # Needed only once
  $ docker run -d -p 15674:15674 myrabbitmq # to start the broker
  ```

## Building and testing

Key npm tasks:

```text
cleanup - Remove generated built artifacts
doc - Generate docs
doc-serve - Generate docs and watch for changes
test - Run tests
lint - run lint on soucres
```

### Basic development workflow

1. Checkout a new branch.
1. Make code changes (src/specs)
1. Run tests:
   ```bash
   $ npm run test
   ```
1. Lint:
   ```bash
   $ npm run lint
   ```
1. Update documentation - do update the docs-src/Changelog.md
1. Regenerate documentation:
   ```bash
   $ npm run doc
   ```
1. Please follow GitHub guidelines. Raise an issue if you are unclear.
